This program is expected to create a blockchain and perform operations on it,
such as adding blocks, searching for a specific block of data, and traversing blocks.

Data Structure used is linked lists, as provided by the problem statement.

Time Complexity: all operations take O(1) time
             except O(n) for searching and traversing the blockchain
             n is the number of blocks in the blockchain

Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of blocks in the blockchain

NOTE:
The blockchain size is maintained as a property in the blockchain class.
Every time we add a block, the method will increment the size.
That's why we get O(1) time in get_size method,
otherwise it would take O(n) to traverse and count the elements.
