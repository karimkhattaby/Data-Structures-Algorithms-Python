This program is expected to check if a user belongs to a group or any of its sub groups.

Data Structure used is lists, as provided by the problem statement.

Time and Space Complexity: O(n*m), where n is the number of groups and m is the number of users

PLEASE NOTE
The solution could have been done in a recursive approach,
which makes more sense for the given problem.
However, an iterative approach is preferred to avoid a potential stack overflow.
The iterative approach also reduces the memory usage of adding function calls to the call stack.
