# Data-Structures-Python
Data Structures Implementation in Python, as well as using data structures to solve lightweight algorithmic problems.

## Overview
This repo includes implemented complex data structures in python.  
So far, the included projects (sub folders) were part of the Udacity Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree. I will update this readme as I add more projects.

## Projects
1. [LRU Cache](https://github.com/karimkhattaby/Data-Structures-Python/tree/master/1%20LRU%20Cache)
    * Implements LRU Cache using Hash Tables.
2. [Files Search](https://github.com/karimkhattaby/Data-Structures-Python/tree/master/2%20Files%20Search)
    * Uses a stack(list) data structure to find files ending with a specific suffix in the file system tree heirarchy.
3. [Data Compression](https://github.com/karimkhattaby/Data-Structures-Python/tree/master/3%20Data%20Compression)
    * Uses a combination of Min Heaps, Hash Tables, and Binary Trees to implement the Huffman Coding Compression Algorithm.
4. [Active Directory](https://github.com/karimkhattaby/Data-Structures-Python/tree/master/4%20Active%20Directory)
    * Uses an array(list) data structure to implement User Groups and find if a user belongs to a group.
5. [Blockchain](https://github.com/karimkhattaby/Data-Structures-Python/tree/master/5%20Blockchain)
    * Uses a modified Linked List class to implement a blockchain.
6. [Linked Lists Union & Intersection](https://github.com/karimkhattaby/Data-Structures-Python/tree/master/6%20Linked%20Lists%20Union%20%26%20Intersection)
    * Uses Hash Tables(set) to find the union and intersection between 2 linked lists and return the result as a new linked list.
