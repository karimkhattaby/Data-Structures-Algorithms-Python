This program is expected to get the min and max values of an array.

No Data Structures were used.
The program uses 2 variables to store the min and max values.

An initial thought of the problem might be to sort the array,
and then return the first and last values in the array.
However, this approach will take O(n log n) time.

A more efficient approach would be to loop through all the values of the array.
And keep track of the minimum and maximum values in the array as it encounters elements.
So whenever it encounters a value greater than the max value stored, it updates it.
And whenever it encounters a value less than the min value stored, it updates it.
After exiting the loop, it will return the min and max values found

Time Complexity: O(n) single traversal, where n is the number of elements in the array.
Space Complexity: O(1)
