# Algorithms
Algorithms Implementation in Python, as well as using data structures to solve lightweight algorithmic problems.

## Overview
This folder includes implemented complex algorithms in python.  
So far, the included projects (sub folders) were part of the Udacity Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree. I will update this readme as I add more projects.

## Projects
1. [Integer Square Root](https://github.com/karimkhattaby/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Python/tree/master/Algorithms/1%20Integer%20Square%20Root)
    * Finds the square root of integer numbers.
2. [Rotated Sorted Array Search](https://github.com/karimkhattaby/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Python/tree/master/Algorithms/2%20Rotated%20Sorted%20Array%20Search)
    * Searches for the index of a given target in a rotated sorted array..
3. [Rearrange Array Elements](https://github.com/karimkhattaby/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Python/tree/master/Algorithms/3%20Rearrange%20Array%20Elements)
    * Rearranges array elements to form 2 numbers such that their sum gives the largest sum possible.
4. [Dutch National Flag Problem](https://github.com/karimkhattaby/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Python/tree/master/Algorithms/4%20Dutch%20National%20Flag%20Problem)
    * Sorts an array of 0s, 1s and 2s in a single traversal.
5. [Text Autocomplete using Tries](https://github.com/karimkhattaby/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Python/tree/master/Algorithms/5%20Text%20Autocomplete%20using%20Tries)
    * Text autocomplete feature implementation using a trie.
6. [Min and Max in an Unsorted Array](https://github.com/karimkhattaby/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Python/tree/master/Algorithms/6%20Min%20and%20Max%20in%20an%20Unsorted%20Array)
    * Finds the minimum and maximum values of an unsorted array in a single traversal.
7. [HTTP Requests Router using Tries](https://github.com/karimkhattaby/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Python/tree/master/Algorithms/7%20HTTP%20Requests%20Router%20using%20Tries)
    * HTTP requests router Implementation using a Trie.
